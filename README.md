# xrb_address_book
(bot controlled) list of reddit users xrb addresses

## users
I'd recommend creating a new wallet, because publicly linking your screen name to an account that holds a significant amount of cash might make you a target for jerks.

To add your address to this list:
Send a DM containing only your xrb address to /u/xrb_address_book on reddit. The contents of the subject line will be ignored.

To change your address, just do the same thing with your new one and the old one will be overwritten.

Updates will take around ten minutes to come into effect.

The inbox of the xrb_address_book account will not be monitored by humans and any messages that do not fit the above criteria will not be seen.


## developers
To use this data in your projects, you can attempt to recover addresses by getting https://manicphase.github.io/xrb_address_book/[reddit username].txt (e.g. [https://manicphase.github.io/xrb_address_book/manicdave.txt](https://manicphase.github.io/xrb_address_book/manicdave.txt)). If the account has been registered, a raw string of the address will be returned.


If you have any problems or questions, contact manicdave on reddit or manicphase on github.
